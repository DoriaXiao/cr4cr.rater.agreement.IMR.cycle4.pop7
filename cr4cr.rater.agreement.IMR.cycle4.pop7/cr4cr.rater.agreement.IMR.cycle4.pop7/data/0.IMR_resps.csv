In 2011 there about that same passenger difference for January but in July there is only about a 50 passenger difference for each year.",The most likely reason is that Europeans like to come to California for their summer vacations more than Christmas vacation. There is a small decrease in how many Asians come to California but The Europeans create the big difference in January. There could also be external forces such as blizzards that prevent them from coming to California.,"I would say it is not enough information. This is because we only get an estimate of people that come from 2 continents. If the goal was to target one of these continents in January as that is time where the difference is drastic, all we have is the difference is passengers. We don't have the external forces that we need to determine why them came or did not come, There reviews on being here, and what they did while they were here. This would create an opportunity to create a campaign that will be more persuasive and bring more tourists.
